// null value does not belong to any of the types
// null forms a separate data type

let age = null;
console.log(age); // shows "null"

//In JavaScript, null is not a “reference to a non-existing object” or a “null pointer” like in some other languages.

// null is a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.
